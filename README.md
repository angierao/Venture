# Venture

Venture aims to simplify the process of finding places to go and planning outings by initiating the discovery process through pictures and videos. Users can choose to either see pictures and videos from 1) a radius of their choice around their current location or 2) any city in the world. Users can swipe right to like, left to dislike, and down to save pictures or videos when they're bored. Later, users can access their saved pictures and videos to see more information about the location, including other Facebook friends that have saved it, distance from the user, address, and price. Venture prompts users to visit a saved location if the user is nearby and recommends other locations to the user using computer vision.
